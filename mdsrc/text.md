## About me

I'm a mathematics student at [Simón Bolívar University](http://www.usb.ve)
(SBU). I'm currently working as a freelancer, doing book design in
LaTeX and Markdown, as I finish my studies at SBU.

## Education

## Interests

I'm interested in typography and computer science, specifically
TeX---for obvious reasons---and UNIX-like operating systems.

## Notes

I intend to keep unordered and possibly unrelated notes about anything
I get enough energy to write about. [This](notes.html) is the place
they'll be.

## Contact

My email is <jalb97@gmail.com>. Also, my phone number is
+58-414-9176851. I have a twitter account @jhonnylanz.
